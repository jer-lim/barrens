# barrens

This is supposed to be a super simple framework for PHP projects. 
It barely does anything and requires the minimum amount of setup that you
have probably already done before.

## Why Use It

I have no idea. I use it for my prior projects in the form of [Prairie](https://github.com/keythkatz/prairie).
This project aims to simplify, modernise, and break up Prairie.

## Features
- Quick install
- Simple routing engine

## Requirements

- Apache2 (or implement your own URL rewriting)
- PHP 7.1 and above

## Setup

You'll need to have **AllowOverride All** enabled for the install directory in Apache
and the **Rewrite** Apache extension enabled.
